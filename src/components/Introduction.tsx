      California is one of the most beautiful parts of the country and our
      economy is booming. A lot of people want to experience our state's
      opportunities but can't because of a shortage of places to live.

        California added 334 thousand residents in 2017, while only 88 thousand
        residences were built in that same period. That's roughly{" "}

      Senate Bill 827 (<b>

      </b>) could change this! SB 827 would change zoning around transit to
      allow for mid-rise housing.
    </p>
    <p>At a high level, the measure would:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Allow more houses to be built near transit stations,</li>
      <li>Block city parking minimums that waste valuable space, and</li>
      <li>
        Set minimum height limits from 45 to 85 feet in places near transit.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This an seem scary at first ("<ExternalLink link="padailypost.com/2018/02/18/housing-bill-result-85-foot-tall-buildings-el-camino">
        Housing bill could result in 85-foot tall buildings on El Camino
      </ExternalLink>"). I totally understand where these fears come from â€” I
      grew up around there, and it's frightening to think about how the places I
      love might change.
    </p>
    <p>
      Digging into the details convinced me how that SB 827 really is a force
      for good. SB 827 makes neighborhoods more vibrant, equitable, and
      eco-friendly! I walked away inspired by the opportunity this bill brings.
      I hope these rendering and perspectives below inspire you.
